# How to use the repository
0. Please make sure that you have set up the environment for the project. Follow the steps listed in [prerequisites](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/documentation/readme/prerequisites.md).

1. To get started with the project, clone the git repository in the go folder:

    ```
    $ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    $ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com -p
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com  
    $ git clone https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT.git
    ```
2. To use the **NLP-Engine** following this [instructions](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/documentation/readme/nlp-engine-use.md)

3. To deploy the **HFB-Network** following this [instructions](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/documentation/readme/hfb-network-use.md)

4. To deploy the **ELK-Infrastructure** following this [instructions](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/documentation/readme/elk-network-use.md)

5. To deploy the **Filebeat-Agent** following this [instructions](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/documentation/readme/filebeat-agent-use.md)

    ‚≠ê The **Filebeat-Agent** is based on the Linux Foundation Project: [Blockchain Analyzer: Analyzing Hyperledger Fabric Ledger, Transactions](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-analyzer)

6. The Backend of the project is:
    - To deploy the **Backend** following this [instructions](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/documentation/readme/backend-use.md).
